Welcome to your new lab, here's the instructions for each exercise :

* Read the lesson entirely!!!!
* Identify your learning goals.
* Understand the context.
* Follow the steps and rules carefully.

You must try to find documentation and solution by yourself. The course contains links to HTML/CSS references and a lot of other interesting websites. Don't forget : the web is your friend ;-)

## Know your elements

### Learning goals

1. Know **how** and **when** to use the different [HTML elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/HTML/Element).
1. Know how to read and understand a [wireframe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website_wireframe).

### Context

We need a summary webpage for a movie saga. It'll describe the different episodes, the cast, some quotes...

### Steps

* Choose a movie saga of at least 3 movies.
* Have a look at the wireframe in [movie-saga.png](../labs-files/be-zen/movie-saga.png) and identify the different HTML elements you'll need.
* Gather the different texts and informations you'll need about your saga.
* Create a valid HTML5 document containing the different parts needed according to the wireframe.

### Rules

* You **MUST** absolutely use these HTML elements : `article`, `section`, `header`, `footer`, `nav`, `hr`, `h1`, `h2`, `h3`, `ul`, `ol`, `thead`, `tbody`, `th`, `dl`, `dt`, `dd`, `form`, `label`, `textarea`
* You **CANNOT** use these HTML elements : `div`, `span`, `br`
* You **MUST** follow all the instructions (post-it) of the wireframe.
* You **MUST** validate your HTML and correct the possible errors.
* You **MUST** cite your sources of information at the bottom.
